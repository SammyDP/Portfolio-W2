I have created a porfolio that follows semantic HTML and has the following sections:

    -Introduction - This section meet the criteria of developer's name, recent photo, and links to "about me", "My work" and "contact me"

    -Services - This section will house future services that i offer with a link to "my work"

    -About Me - This section will have information about me

    -My Work - This section will be an area that has picture links of future projects to show work I have done in the past

    -Contact - This section has a link to contact me by email, followed by social media icons to link to other forms of contact

Another criteria of this portfolio is to be responsive and to adapt to different view sizes

I have also created a wireframe mock up of my portfolio created with figma

Comments have been added to organize my code and/or to remind me of a particular function
